This is the web presence of the Julia@Trieste community. We are a group of people, interested in or 
already enjoying the daily us of the [Julia](https://julialang.org) programming language.
Julia is a high-level, high-performance, dynamic programming language. It walks like Python and runs like C. It is particularly well-suited for numerical analysis, computational science, and high-performance computing.

We live, work, or are otherwise related to the city of [Trieste](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trieste), a town located at the north-east Italian borded with Slovenia. Trieste features a conspicuous scientific community of more than 30 research institutions, universities and S&T centers, with a peak working presence of some 8,000 scientists. This gives the city a ratio of over 35 scientists every 1,000 workers, against an European average of less than six.

By kickstarting this community, through its Telegram group (**Julia@Trieste**) and GitHub public [repository](https://github.com/julia-trieste), we aim at create a critical mass of users to exchange information, learning opportunities, and collaborative interactions to happily experience Julia in the
most fruitful way possible.
